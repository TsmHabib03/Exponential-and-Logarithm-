            <p class="fade-in">
                Dive into the world of General Mathematics as we explore key concepts like exponential functions, growth and decay models, and the transformation between exponential and logarithmic forms. Learn how to solve logarithmic equations, understand the inverse relationships of exponential and logarithmic functions, and apply mathematical principles to real-life scenarios like interest calculations‚Äîsimple, compound, and continuous. Plus, explore propositions that form the foundation of mathematical reasoning and problem-solving.

            <h2>Exponentials</h2>
            <p>The exponential function is a mathematical function denoted by or. Unless otherwise specified, the term generally refers to the positive-valued function of a real variable, although it can be extended to the complex numbers or generalized to other mathematical objects like matrices or Lie algebras. </p><br>

     <h3>Exponential Function</h3>
     <a class="link" href="Exponential Function.html">An exponential function is a Mathematical function in the form <b>f (x) = ax</b> , where <b>‚Äúx‚Äù</b> is a variable and  <b>‚Äúa‚Äù</b> is a constant which is called the base of the function and it should be greater than 0. The most commonly used exponential function base is the transcendental number e, which is approximately equal to  <b>2.71828.</b> </a>
   </div>
     <div class="feature-card">
       <h3>Exponential Models</h3>
       <a class="link" href="Exponential model.html">An exponential model is a function reflecting a quantity which grows or decays at a rate proportional to its current value. The functions are of the form <b> y = a(b)</b> where <b>a</b> is the initial amount and <b>b</b> is the rate of growth or decay.</a>

      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Zeros of an Exponential Function</h3>
        <a class="link" href="Zeros of an Exponential Function.html">The zero of an exponential function is the point where the graph crosses the x-axis.
 
          The zero can be computed by equating the function value to zero. Just like how we do it with other functions.
 
          Note: Not all exponential functions have zeros.</a>
      </div>
      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Exponential Equation</h3>
        <a class="link" href="Exponential Equation.html">An exponential equation is an equation involving exponential expressions.
        
        An exponential expression is an expression of the form a bx-c+d, where b>0 and b=1.</a>
      </div>
      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Exponential Inequalities</h3>
        <a class="link" href="Exponential Inequalities.html">Property of Exponential Inequalities:
<br>
1. If b > 1 then the exponential function y=bx is increasing for all x. This means that bx < by if and only if x < y.
<br>
2. If 0 < b < 1 then the exponential function y=b* is decreasing for all x. This means that bx > by if and only if x < y.</a>

     <h3>Solving logarithmic equation</h3>
     <a class="link" href="Solving logarithmic equation.html">
     To solve a logarithmic equation, you typically use logarithmic properties to simplify and isolate the logarithmic expression. Then, you can convert the equation to an exponential form to find the variable.</a>

            <h2>Interest</h2>
            <p>In finance and economics, interest is payment from a debtor or deposit-taking financial institution to a lender or depositor of an amount above repayment of the principal sum, at a particular rate. It is distinct from a fee which the borrower may pay to the lender or some third party.</p>

     <h3>Simple Interest</h3>
     <a class="link" href="Simple Interest.html">Interest is the cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of the loan. Simple interest is an annual percentage of the amount borrowed, referred to as the annual interest rate. </a>

      <div class="features-container">
   <div class="feature-card">
     <h3>Compound Interest</h3>
     <a class="link" href="Compound Interest.html">Compound interest is interest accumulated from a principal sum and previously accumulated interest. It is the result of reinvesting or retaining interest that would otherwise be paid out, or of the accumulation of debts from a borrower.

         <div class="features-container">
   <div class="feature-card">
     <h3>Continuous Interest</h3>
     <a class="link" href="Compound Interest.html">Continuous compound interest is a formula for loan interest where the balance grows continuously over time, rather than being computed at discrete intervals.

            <h2>Proposition</h2>
            <p>A proposition is a statement that is either true or false. In our course, we will usually call a mathematical proposition a theorem. A theorem is a main result. A proposition that is mainly of interest to prove a larger theorem is called a lemma.</p>

                  <h3>Proposition</h3>
                  <a class="link" href="Proposition.html">This kind of sentences are called propositions. If a proposition is true, then we say it has a truth value of "true"; if a proposition is false, its truth value is "false". For example, "Grass is green", and "2 + 5 = 5" are propositions. The first proposition has the truth value of "true" and the second "false".</a>
