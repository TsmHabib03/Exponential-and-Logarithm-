            <h2>Exponentials</h2>
            <p>The exponential function is a mathematical function denoted by or. Unless otherwise specified, the term generally refers to the positive-valued function of a real variable, although it can be extended to the complex numbers or generalized to other mathematical objects like matrices or Lie algebras. </p><br>

     <h3>Exponential Function</h3>
     <a class="link" href="Exponential Function.html">An exponential function is a Mathematical function in the form <b>f (x) = ax</b> , where <b>‚Äúx‚Äù</b> is a variable and  <b>‚Äúa‚Äù</b> is a constant which is called the base of the function and it should be greater than 0. The most commonly used exponential function base is the transcendental number e, which is approximately equal to  <b>2.71828.</b> </a>
   </div>
     <div class="feature-card">
       <h3>Exponential Models</h3>
       <a class="link" href="Exponential model.html">An exponential model is a function reflecting a quantity which grows or decays at a rate proportional to its current value. The functions are of the form <b> y = a(b)</b> where <b>a</b> is the initial amount and <b>b</b> is the rate of growth or decay.</a>

        <h3>Zeros of an Exponential Function</h3>
        <a class="link" href="Zeros of an Exponential Function.html">The zero of an exponential function is the point where the graph crosses the x-axis.
 
          The zero can be computed by equating the function value to zero. Just like how we do it with other functions.
 
          Note: Not all exponential functions have zeros.</a>
      </div>

        <h3>Exponential Equation</h3>
        <a class="link" href="Exponential Equation.html">An exponential equation is an equation involving exponential expressions.
        
        An exponential expression is an expression of the form a bx-c+d, where b>0 and b=1.</a>

        <h3>Exponential Inequalities</h3>
        <a class="link" href="Exponential Inequalities.html">Property of Exponential Inequalities:
<br>
1. If b > 1 then the exponential function y=bx is increasing for all x. This means that bx < by if and only if x < y.
<br>
2. If 0 < b < 1 then the exponential function y=b* is decreasing for all x. This means that bx > by if and only if x < y.</a>
